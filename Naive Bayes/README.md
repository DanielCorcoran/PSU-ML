Spambase.py is a naive Bayes classifier that operates on the spambase dataset (found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase).  A certain amount of preprocessing was done to separate the dataset into 3 sets: a training set of 1,381 emails that are not spam, a training set of 920 emails that are spam, and a test set of 2,300 emails that are 40% spam and 60% not spam.  After training, the program generates a confusion matrix on the test data, as well as the accuracy, precision, and recall of the classifier.

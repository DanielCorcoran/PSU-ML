## Knapsack problem using a genetic algorithm

This program implements a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem.  The knapsack problem aims to fill a knapsack with items of varying weights and values to create the largest value without going over the maximum allowed weight.  A list of objects with random values of weight and value from 1-100 is created, then a population of genomes is created in which each genome is randomly assigned any number of objects.  Genomes that exceed the allowed weight are useless, and as such, are given a fitness value of 0.  Two parents are randomly selected from the population and their lists of items is switched at a randomly selected crossover point.  For example, if the crossover point is at the fifth item in a 10 item list, one child will have items 1-5 from one parent and 6-10 from the other, and the other child will have the other data from the parents.  Mutation is also used to randomly introduce changes to the children which may not be possible otherwise.  The two genomes with the lowest fitness index in the population are replaced by the new children and the process is repeated until a certain number of iterations have occurred.  At the end of this process, the genome in the population with the highest fitness index has the optimal items to maximize value while also staying under the maximum weight.

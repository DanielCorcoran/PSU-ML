## Multi Layer Perceptron
The MLP.py file trains a 2 layer perceptron on the MNIST dataset (found at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) over a set number of epochs and produces a graph of training/test accuracy as a function of epoch number.  To run the program, the 4 datasets (including labels) must be extracted and in the same folder as MLP.py.
